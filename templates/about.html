            osu! has stolen many months away from my life. I don't expect compensation and code this for my own
            enjoyment as well as others, but nevertheless donations are welcome and much appreciated. Any moneydonated
            will go directly towards hosting and future development of osu!

                Well this is quite fun to make in python flask, tho i still cant figure out how to save replay :((<br/>
                Everything on the frontend is from ilyt's <a href='https://github.com/hzlnut/osu-2007'> remake of osu 2007 server </a> since
                I'm lazy to create a frontend
                <br/>
                <br/>[added by ilyt]<br/>
                osu-classic is a remake of how osu was in 2007, aimed at bringing back nostalgia to players from the beginning<br>
                or just to give new players an idea of how osu! once was.
                It's a fun side project for me (ilyt) and peppy appears to approve of it, so why not!
