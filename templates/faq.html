        <br />
        <br />
        Oh, ok. Well, Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan is a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS. The gameplay consists of only three
        elements: tapping circles on the touchscreen, dragging a ball across a fixed path and rotating a spinner very
        fast. All these elements are timed to (covers of) popular Japanese songs. It looks like this on the DS:<br />
        <br />
        <img src="http://osu.ppy.sh/img/ouendan.jpg"
            src="http://osu.ppy.sh/img/ouendan.jpg" alt=""><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        You can see the circles on the bottom screen, and on the top screen you have the story. Each stage is basically
        a self-contained story about a person in trouble. That's where the Ouendan (Cheer squad) comes in. Through the
        magical power of male cheerleading, you have to help the people in trouble.<br />
        <br />

        <font color="#ff0040"><b>How do I play?!</b></font><br />
        While most PC users won't have a touchscreen at their disposal (unless you are a lucky one to own a tablet PC),
        this game is made to be playable with a normal mouse, as well as any number of input devices you can possible
        think of (wiimote works quite well, as does a graphics tablet if you have one of them laying around). There are
        some songs which push the limits of the normal mouse, but all have been tested and are (somehow) passable using
        only a mouse. Please don't let the lack of a touchscreen deter you!<br />
        <br />
        Let's move on to the gameplay.<br />
        <br />

        ^ Here you can see the circles you have to tap. The smaller coloured circle on the outside shrinks and you have
        to hit the note at the exact point the outside circle overlaps with the white border. Don't rely on your eyes,
        though: listening to the music to decide the right moment is better.<br />
        <br />

        ^ Here we have a slider thrown into the mix. First, you have to hit it at the right moment, but it doesn't end
        there. A ball will start to move across the path you see. You have to hold the mousebutton and keep your pointer
        on the ball as it moves (you do not control the movement yourself). Sometimes, as in the screenshot above, you
        have to move back at the end of the path. You can tell by the reverse symbol at the end of the path.<br />

        ^ This is a spinner. You have to click on the inner yellow-red disc, hold the mouse, and spin like mad before
        the time runs out. The bars on the outside indicate how close you are to passing. On the DS, these are a good
        way to scratch your touchscreen (or screen protectors if you're smart), especially on the higher difficulties.
        In osu!, spinners have been toned down as to not be such a nuisance to complete. While holding a mouse button on
        a spinner, your <b>mouse is locked into the spin area</b>, so you can go crazy, or just spin very small circles
        - watch some of the top replays if you are interested in spinning styles!<br />

        ^ This is the game interface. The top left bar is your "health". This will decrease at a steady rate, but you
        can replenish it by hitting notes at the right time. A perfectly timed hit will increase your health more than a
        badly timed hit. A total miss will take a good chunk out of your health. Next to the health bar is your score.
        The scoring system takes a while to figure out, but I won't bore you with the details here. The number on the
        bottom left is the combo counter/score multiplier.<br />

        <font color="#ff0040"><b>How do I start a new beatmap?</b></font><br />
        As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to
        avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes until you are more experienced at beatmapping. To start a new
        beatmap, follow these simple steps:
        <ol>
            <li>Place your song file (in .mp3 or .ogg format) into the <b>/Songs directory</b>, then open osu!.
                Alternatively, if osu! is already open, you can drag and drop the audio file directly into the osu!
                window.
            <li>Open up Edit Mode. Your new song will be at the <b>bottom</b> of the song list, highlighted in <font
                    color="#8000FF"><b>purple</b></font>.
            <li>Click on the song to open up Song Setup. Check that the song title and artist are correct, then enter in
                an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples).
            <li>You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can
                start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.
        </ol>

        <font color="#ff0040"><b>How do I time a song properly?</b></font><br />
        Timing is <b>vital</b> - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking. Make sure your timing is
        perfect before putting any notes in. <b>If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first</b>, or submit
        your song into the <a
            href="http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=10">Beatmap Help
            forum</a>. This will save a LOT of hassle later on. Here are some tips for getting your timing right:
        <ul>
            <li>Watch the <a
                    href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=eih3jnEqw0A">video
                    tutorial</a> for basic timing methods.
            <li>Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song <b>for the entire length of the
                    song</b>. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
            <li>Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (eg. 125.02), it is probably
                (but not always) that whole number (eg. 125). If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing
                Setup Panel.
            <li>For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the
                values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
            <li>Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (<u>Timing--&gt;Add
                    Timing Section</u>) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be
                found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.
        </ul>
        <a href="#top">

        <font color="#ff0040"><b>Adding normal hit circles</b></font><br />
        This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:
        <ul>
            <li>The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to <u>View--&gt;Grid Level</u>. Notes will
                automatically snap to the grid.
            <li>You can override grid snapping and time snapping by <b>holding shift</b> while performing a
                move/placement action.
            <li>Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will <b>delete</b> them. Right-clicking elsewhere
                will toggle a <b>new combo</b>.
            <li>Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is
                copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
            <li>Notes will snap to <b>visible</b> sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a
                slider, place it while you can still see the slider and <b>then</b> move it forward/backward in the
                timeline if necessary.
        </ul>
        <a href="#top">
            <font size="1">Back to top</font>
        </a><br />
        <br />
        <a name="BM4"></a>
        <font color="#ff0040"><b>Adding Sliders</b></font><br />
        Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the <b>Timing tab</b>) to your preferred value. This value
                will apply for the <b>entire beatmap</b>, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing
                sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
            <li>Set the type of slider you want (<u>Options--&gt;Slider Curve Type</u>). There are three types of curves
                - Catmull, Bezier and Linear. Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. Linear
                mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders.
        </ul>
        Now you can begin adding a slider. <b>Left-click</b> to start the slider, add waypoints with further
        left-clicks, and terminate with a <b>right-click</b>. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is
        correct before adjusting the shape. Here are some other tips regarding sliders:
        <ul>
            <li>To add <b>repeats</b> on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the <b>timeline</b> after finishing
                placement.
            <li>Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
                If you want really nice curved sliders, use lots of waypoints!
            <li>In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by <b>holding shift</b>. This can be
                useful for aligning sliders perfectly.
        </ul>
        Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain ugly sliders really
        ruin the look of a beatmap!<br />

        <a name="BM5"></a>
        <font color="#ff0040"><b>Adding Spinners</b></font><br />
        To add a spinner to your map, <b>left-click</b> to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end
        to be, and terminate with a <b>right-click</b>. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long
        spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. "Spinner spam" is a definite
        no-no! (Except Wizards in Winter beatmaps)<br />

        <font color="#ff0040"><b>What are Combos?</b></font><br />
        Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is
        important that you use combos in your beatmaps - as a rough guide, the maximum length of a combo should be 15-20
        (but combo lengths of around 10 are better). You can also try and add colour to your beatmaps by using new
        combos to your advantage!<br />

        <font color="#ff0040"><b>How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?</b></font><br />
        To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave
        a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the <b>Insert Break Time</b> button in the
        editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to "mark
        out" the break before inserting one! A couple of rules of thumb are:
        <ul>
            <li>Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. For example, a two minute song should have
                at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenlyi
                spaced, etc.
            <li>Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless, and breaks of 30
                seconds are boring. Try and aim for 5-10 second breaks.
        </ul>
        Here are some <b>advanced</b> tips on planning breaks through the use of <b>Bookmarks</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one
                at regular intervals.
            <li>Use bookmarks to mark out the <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> of each break on the timeline!
            <li>Put in a temporary "marker" (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click "Insert Break
                Time" whilst you are in between to add the break.
            <li>An example is shown below. Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too
                short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without
                falling asleep in the meantime!<br />
                <img src="http://peppy.chigau.com/eyupmarks.jpg">
            <li>Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use
                them to your advantage.
        </ul>

        <font color="#ff0040"><b>What is Beat Spacing?</b></font><br />
        For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good "beat spacing"! <a
            href="http://peppy.chigau.com/Beat%20Spacing.jpg">A quick
            illustration of what good and bad beat spacing is can be found here</a>. In general, beats that are close
        together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa.<br />
        <br />
        The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's <b>Distance
            Snapping</b> function, found on the right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can
        be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing
        is guaranteed!<br />

        <font color="#ff0040"><b>How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?</b></font><br />
        To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose <u>File--&gt;Save As...</u> and
        change the entry in the Difficulty box. Try and add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take
        away or rearrange note combinations. At the very least, flip or rotate the notes! Do not simply change the
        difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) and think that constitutes a new beatmap!<br />

        Click on the <b>Design Tab</b>. There is a button called "<b>Set BG Colour</b>" which allows you to choose your
        own background colour.<br />

        Click on the <b>Design Tab</b>. There is a button called "<b>Insert Background</b>". When clicked, a dialog box
        will appear, allowing you to browse to the image or video you want added. The image/video will automatically be
        copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. Some notes:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Images</b> can be in JPG or PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size.
            <li><b>Videos</b> should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Try and remove the audio to save on
                file size. Also look at <a

            <li>Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder.

        Your pride and joy can be uploaded to the forums using <u>File--&gt;Upload Beatmap</u>. Choose whether you want
        to submit to the Completed or Beatmap Help forums. The beatmap description and a download link will be
        automatically posted for you - simply enter a brief message and when the upload is finished, click Submit! Some
        more notes:
        <ul>
            <li>The submitted .osz archives contain all beatmaps for that particular song - along with audio, video and
                image files.
            <li>If you choose to post to the Completed forum, it will be reviewed by beatmap moderators and the general
                public and feedback left for you. If it is deemed to be of good quality, it will be ranked!
            <li>Post to the Beatmap Help forum if you need help with timing, or want feedback on a partially completed
                map.
            <li>If a mod suggests some improvements and you make changes to your beatmap(s), simply follow the same
                process for uploading as before to update the archive. If you have added any new files (e.g. background
                image, sound effects) since the last upload, check the "Force re-upload" box in the Upload Beatmap
                screen and the new archive will be re-uploaded.
